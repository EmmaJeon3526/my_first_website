<h2>Dog History, 강아지의 역사</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" target="_blank" title="dog wikipedia">The dog, Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris</a> is <strong>a domesticated descendant of the wolf.</strong> <br>Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and <u>the modern wolf</u> is the dog's nearest living relative.</p>
<p>Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture. <br>Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</p>
