<h2>Dog Breeds, 강아지 종류</h2>
<p>Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds. 
In the Victorian era, directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes.
Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years,
and since then dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to artificial selection imposed by humans. 
The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. 
These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour. 
Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, and hunting,retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression,
which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs.[8] As a result, present day dogs are the most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world.
The most striking example of this dispersal is that of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the Victorian era.
